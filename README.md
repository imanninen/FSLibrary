# File system library on kotlin
This library creates file system by given path, regarding to root project directory. It can create folders and files with given content. 

I used `kotlinc path/to/src/files/lib.kt -d FileSysytemLib.jar` command to compile my code to kotlin library.

[Here](https://github.com/imanninen/FSLibrary/blob/main/FileSysytemLib.jar) is a library file.

All tests are implemented using jetBrains plugin for JUnit tests. 
All tests I run on spesific directory, to don't delete something important accidentally.
